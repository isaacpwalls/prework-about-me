        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am currently a student enrolled in Full Stack Program at the University of Washington Coding Boot Camp. In my previous life, I was an operations supervisor for different logistics companies, with my longest stint of almost 8 years at United
            Parcel Service.</p>

            in the Dark by Carl Sagan. I'm a big fan of dystopian anything, although I had to chill on Black Mirror...it's curating reality. So as far as I'm concerned, I think it should be canceled. I

        <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>To serve my City. Tacoma has been good to me.</p>
        <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>After living in Atlanta for 3 years, I am back home in Tacoma!</p>
        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>While living in Atlanta, I was working as a Project Manager/Operations Manager for RoofCo. While I was there, my cousin and I had what we felt was a great idea and so we decided we wanted to learn how to make an app. We began learning how to code
            a bit and began putting an app together. Little did we know what we were in for...I didn't have an appreciation for apps I used until this endeavor. It was easily one of the more labor intensive ventures we've undertaken. After 100s of hours,
            we had an app...or so we thought. It was an exhilerating experience seeing your baby come to life in the real world. ...But the app was extremely slow. And the UI/UX was horrible. And it did not function the way we wanted. We hit the wall.
            I want to know how to knock that wall down with a wrecking ball. This is why I want to be a developer.
